Hey there! I'm Lakshmi ðŸš€
Data engineer by trade, storyteller by designâ€”I'm passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights and crafting compelling visualizations. Iâ€™ve built scalable ETL pipelines, engineered cloud solutions, and brought data to life with tools like Tableau and Power BI. Python, Kafka, and big datasets are my go-to, but Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to turn data into impact.
Ready to collaborate on the next big thing or chat about data-driven storytelling? Letâ€™s connect and make something awesome happen! ðŸŒŸ
